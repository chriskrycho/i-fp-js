/**
  Map over a `Maybe` instance: apply the function to the wrapped value if the
  instance is `Just`, and return `Nothing` if the instance is `Nothing`.

  `Maybe.map` works a lot like `Array.prototype.map`: `Maybe` and `Array` are
  both *containers* for other things. If you have no items in an array of
  numbers named `foo` and call `foo.map(x => x + 1)`, you'll still just have an
  array with nothing in it. But if you have any items in the array (`[2, 3]`),
  and you call `foo.map(x => x + 1)` on it, you'll get a new array with each of
  those items inside the array "container" transformed (`[3, 4]`).

  That's exactly what's happening with `Maybe.map`. If the container is *empty*
  – the `Nothing` variant – you just get back an empty container. If the
  container has something in it – the `Just` variant – you get back a container
  with the item inside transformed.

  (So... why not just use an array? The biggest reason is that an array can be
  any length. With a `Maybe`, we're capturing the idea of "something or
  nothing" rather than "0 to n" items. And this lets us implement a whole set
  of *other* interfaces, like those in this module.)

/**
  Apply a function to the wrapped value if `Just` and return a new `Just`
  containing the resulting value; or return `Nothing` if `Nothing`.

  This differs from `map` in that `thenFn` returns another `Maybe`. You can use
  `andThen` to combine two functions which *both* create a `Maybe` from an
  unwrapped type.

  You may find the `.then` method on an ES6 `Promise` helpful for comparison:
  if you have a `Promise`, you can pass its `then` method a callback which
  returns another `Promise`, and the result will not be a *nested* promise, but
  a single `Promise`. The difference is that `Promise#then` unwraps *all*
  layers to only ever return a single `Promise` value, whereas `Maybe.andThen`
  will not unwrap nested `Maybe`s.

  This is also commonly known as (and therefore aliased as) [`flatMap`] or
  [`chain`]. It is sometimes also known as `bind`, but *not* aliased as such
  because [`bind` already means something in JavaScript][bind].

  [`flatMap`]: #flatmap
  [`chain`]: #chain
  [bind]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind

  #### Example

  (This is a somewhat contrived example, but it serves to show the way the
  function behaves.)

  ```ts
  import Maybe from 'true-myth/maybe';

  // string -> Maybe<number>
  const toMaybeLength = (s: string): Maybe<number> => Maybe.of(s.length);

  // Maybe<string>
  const aMaybeString = Maybe.of('Hello, there!');

  // Maybe<number>
  const resultingLength = Maybe.andThen(toMaybeLength, aMaybeString);
  console.log(Maybe.toString(resultingLength)); // 13
  ```

  Note that the result is not `(Just(13))`, but `13`!

  @typeparam T  The type of the wrapped value.
  @typeparam T  The type of the wrapped value in the resulting `Maybe`.
  @param thenFn The function to apply to the wrapped `T` if `maybe` is `Just`.
  @param maybe  The `Maybe` to evaluate and possibly apply a function to the
                contents of.
  @returns      The result of the `thenFn` (a new `Maybe`) if `maybe` is a
                `Just`, otherwise `Nothing` if `maybe` is a `Nothing`.

  unwrapping the value if it is `Just` and applying a value to generate the same
  default type if it is `Nothing`, lets you supply functions which may transform
  the wrapped type if it is `Just` or get a default value for `Nothing`.

  This is kind of like a poor man's version of pattern matching, which
  JavaScript currently lacks.

  Instead of code like this:

  ```ts
  import Maybe from 'true-myth/maybe';

  const logValue = (mightBeANumber: Maybe<number>) => {
    const valueToLog = Maybe.isJust(mightBeANumber)
      ? Maybe.unsafelyUnwrap(mightBeANumber).toString()
      : 'Nothing to log.';

    console.log(valueToLog);
  };
  ```

  ...we can write code like this:

  ```ts
  import Maybe from 'true-myth/maybe';

  const logValue = (mightBeANumber: Maybe<number>) => {
    const value = Maybe.match(
      {
        Just: n => n.toString(),
        Nothing: () => 'Nothing to log.',
      },
      mightBeANumber
    );

    console.log(value);
  };
  ```

  This is slightly longer to write, but clearer: the more complex the resulting
  expression, the hairer it is to understand the ternary. Thus, this is
  especially convenient for times when there is a complex result, e.g. when
  rendering part of a React component inline in JSX/TSX.
